title: "REUSE Specification â€“ Version 3.2"
---

This specification defines a standardised method for declaring copyright and
licensing for software projects. The goal of the specification is to have
comprehensive, unambiguous, human- and machine-readable copyright and licensing
information for each individual file in a project. Ideally this information is
embedded into every file, so that the information is preserved when the file is
copied and reused by third parties.

This specification implements [IETF RFC 2119: Key words for use in RFCs to
Indicate Requirement Levels](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

For the revision history of this specification, please see [the change
log](https://git.fsfe.org/reuse/docs/src/branch/stable/CHANGELOG.md).

## Definitions

These are the definitions for some of the terms used in this specification:

- REUSE Tool --- helper tool for compliance with this specification; available
  at <https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-tool>.
- Project --- any unit of content that can be associated with a distribution of
  software. Typically, a Project is composed of one or more files. Also
  sometimes called a package.
- License File --- a file containing the text of a license.
- Licensing Information --- the information that lists the copyright holders of
  a file or work, and describes under which licenses the file or work is made
  available.
- Copyright Notice --- a line of text that conveys copyright of a copyright
  holder. Its format is defined in the [Format of Copyright
  Notices](#format-of-copyright-notices) section.
- Covered File --- any file in a Project, except for
    - The License Files.
    - `COPYING` and `LICENSE`, with or without file extensions.
    - The files belonging to the Project's version control system (example:
      `.git/`).
    - The files ignored by the version control system (example: files listed in
      `.gitignore`).
    - Submodules of the Project's version control system and Meson subprojects.
      Each submodule and Meson subproject is understood as a separate Project.
    - The files in the `.reuse/` directory in the root of the Project. This
      directory MUST contain only files relevant for the operation of the REUSE
      Tool.
    - Symlinks and files with no data (zero-byte).
    - SPDX documents in their various formats as defined in the [SPDX
      Specification, Clause
      4.4](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/conformance/#44-standard-data-format-requirements)
      (example: `sbom.spdx.json`).
- Commentable File --- a plain text file that can contain comments.
- Snippet --- a portion of text in a Commentable File to which different
  Licensing Information applies.
- Uncommentable File --- either a plain text file that cannot contain comments
  or a file that is not a plain text file.
- SPDX Specification --- SPDX specification, version 2.3; as available on
  <https://spdx.org/specifications>.
- SPDX License Identifier --- SPDX short-form identifier, as defined in SPDX
  Specification. See also <https://spdx.org/ids> for a short introduction and
  examples.
- SPDX License Expression --- as defined in SPDX Specification, Annex D, at
  <https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/SPDX-license-expressions/>.
- SPDX License List --- a list of commonly found licenses and exceptions; as
  available on <https://spdx.org/licenses/>.
- DEP5 --- [Machine-readable `debian/copyright` file, Version
  1.0](https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/).
  Where the REUSE Specification and DEP5 state different things, the REUSE
  Specification takes precedence. Specifically in the case of the `Copyright`
  and `License` tags.

## License Files

A Project MUST include a License File for every license under which Covered
Files are licensed.

Each License File MUST be placed in the `LICENSES/` directory in the root of the
Project. The name of the License File MUST be the SPDX License Identifier of the
license followed by an appropriate file extension (example:
`LICENSES/GPL-3.0-or-later.txt`). The License File MUST be in plain text format.

If a license does not exist in the SPDX License List, its SPDX License
Identifier MUST be `LicenseRef-[idstring]` as defined by the SPDX Specification,
Clause 10 available at
<https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/other-licensing-information-detected/>.

A Project MUST NOT include License Files for licenses under which none of the
files in the Project are licensed. The `LICENSES/` directory MUST NOT include
any other files.

Everything that applies to licenses in this section also applies to license
exceptions, with the exception that it is NOT possible to have a license
exception that does not exist in the SPDX License List.

For avoidance of doubt, in practice this means that for every license and
exception that is part of any SPDX License Expression in any Licensing
Information associated with any Covered File, there MUST exist a License File as
defined in this section.

You MAY include a `COPYING` or `LICENSE` file (with or without file extensions)
in your project for compliance with other standards, conventions, or tools.
These files MAY contain a copy of the license text, a summary of your licensing,
or anything else. These files are ignored by the REUSE Tool.

## Licensing Information

Each Covered File MUST have Licensing Information associated with it. You can
associate Licensing Information with a file in the following ways:

- Comment headers
- REUSE.toml
- DEP5 (deprecated)

REUSE.toml and DEP5 are mutually exclusive. You MUST NOT use both
simultaneously.

Additionally, you can associate Licensing Information with Snippets inside of
files.

### Comment headers

Wherever possible, you SHOULD attempt to use comment headers to convey a file's
Licensing Information. Compared to other methods, comment headers are more
explicit and their associated Licensing Information is more resistant to being
moved or copied.

To implement this method, a Commentable File MUST declare the file's Licensing
Information in a comment header. The Licensing Information SHOULD be as close to
the top of the top of the file as possible in a comment header. The Commentable
File SHOULD use UTF-8 encoding.

For Uncommentable Files, the comment header that declares the file's Licensing
Information MUST be in an adjacent text file of the same name with the
additional extension `.license` (example: `cat.jpg.license` if the original file
is `cat.jpg`). The adjacent file SHOULD use UTF-8 encoding.

`.license` files MAY be used with Commentable Files, but it is still RECOMMENDED
that comment headers be put inside Commentable Files.

The comment header MUST contain one or more Copyright Notices and one or more
`SPDX-License-Identifier` tag-value pairs. A tag is followed by a colon,
followed by a text value, and terminated by a newline.

The `SPDX-License-Identifier` tag MUST be followed by a valid SPDX License
Expression describing the licensing of the file (example:
`SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later OR Apache-2.0`).

An example of a comment header:

```
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2016, 2018-2019 Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2019 Example Organisation
#
# SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
```

#### In-line Snippet comments

Sometimes Licensing Information only applies to a certain Snippet instead of the
whole Commentable File. For these cases SPDX snippet tags MUST be used for that
Snippet (as defined in [SPDX Specification, Annex
H](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/file-tags/#h3-snippet-tags-format)).
This means that Copyright Notices inside of Snippets MUST be prefixed with
`SPDX-SnippetCopyrightText`.

Like with comment headers, the SPDX snippet tags SHOULD be commented.

A Snippet SHOULD contain both a Copyright Notice and an SPDX License Expression.

Example:

```
# SPDX-SnippetBegin
# SPDX-SnippetCopyrightText: 2022 Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

print("Hello, world!")

# SPDX-SnippetEnd
```

#### Ignore block

If Licensing Information is declared in a file without describing the file's or
Snippet's actual license or copyright (for example: as part of an output command
or documentation), these occurrences SHOULD be put between two comments:
`REUSE-IgnoreStart` and `REUSE-IgnoreEnd`. The REUSE Tool then ignores all
Licensing Information between these comments. This technique MUST NOT be used to
ignore valid Licensing Information.

An example for an ignored block:

```
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2021 Jane Doe
#
# SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later

# REUSE-IgnoreStart
echo "SPDX-FileCopyrightText: $(date +'%Y') John Doe" > file.txt
echo "SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT" > file.txt
# REUSE-IgnoreEnd
```

### REUSE.toml

Licensing Information MAY be associated with a file through a
`REUSE.toml` file. The intended use case of this method is large directories where
including a comment header in each file (or in `.license` companion files) is
impossible or undesirable.

A `REUSE.toml` file MAY be located in any directory, and can cover files that are
within its directory or deeper. You MAY have multiple `REUSE.toml` files in
different directories.

The `version` key (REQUIRED) MUST have an integer value representing the schema
version of the file. This specification describes version 1 of `REUSE.toml`.

Each `[[annotations]]` table represents an association of Licensing Information
to zero or more Covered Files. It has the following keys:

- `path` (REQUIRED), a string or list of strings representing paths. A path MUST
  use forward slashes as path separators. A path SHOULD resolve to one or more
  Covered Files relative to the `REUSE.toml` file's directory. A path MAY use
  globbing to match several Covered Files in a single expression. These are the
  globbing and matching rules:
  - `*` matches everything except forward slashes (i.e. path separators).
  - `**` and `**/` match everything including forward slashes (i.e. path
    separators).
  - In order to escape an asterisk and include it verbatim, prefix it with `\\`.
    You cannot prefix it with `\` because that is invalid TOML. In order to
    include a backslash verbatim, use `\\\\`. `\\` followed by any other
    character is functionally equal to just typing that character.
- `precedence` (OPTIONAL), a literal string. It determines the order of
  precedence for Licensing Information between the `REUSE.toml` file and Covered
  Files in the table, and between multiple `REUSE.toml` files if they both
  contain Licensing Information for the same Covered File. Available values are:
  - `closest`, the default value when `precedence` is not defined. This is an
    instruction to associate the Licensing Information inside of the Covered
    Files, if available. If no such Licensing Information is found, then the
    Licensing Information inside the table of the closest `REUSE.toml` that
    covers the File is associated. This algorithm is applied separately for
    copyright and for licensing. If a table for the same File in a closer
    `REUSE.toml` file has the `override` precedence, then that precedence is
    applied, and `closest` is ignored. This is effectively a fallback.
  - `aggregate`. This is an instruction to always associate the Licensing
    Information defined in the table with the table's Covered Files.
    Subsequently, the `closest` logic is also applied.
  - `override`. This is an instruction to associate the Licensing Information
    defined in the table with the table's Covered Files, and to ignore any other
    Licensing Information that is closer to the Files. The table in the
    `REUSE.toml` that is the closest to the root of the Project is
    authoritative.
- `SPDX-FileCopyrightText` (OPTIONAL), a string or list of strings. Each string
  MUST be a Copyright Notice to be associated with the table's Covered Files.
  The prefix of the Copyright Notice MAY be omitted.
- `SPDX-License-Identifier` (OPTIONAL), a string or list of strings. Each string
  MUST be a valid SPDX License Expression describing the licensing of the
  table's Covered Files.

You MAY include other keys and tables to convey additional information. Their
semantics are not defined by this specification.

Although the keys to associate Licensing Information with the Covered File are
OPTIONAL, the complete Licensing Information MUST still be associated with the
File in some fashion.

If a Covered File is covered by multiple `[[annotations]]` tables in the same
`REUSE.toml` file, then exclusively the last matching table in the file is used
for that Covered File.

An example of a `REUSE.toml` file:

```toml
version = 1

[[annotations]]
path = ["po/*.po", "po/*.pot"]
precedence = "aggregate"
SPDX-FileCopyrightText = "2019 Translation Company"
SPDX-License-Identifier = "GPL-3.0-or-later"
```

### DEP5 (deprecated)

Licensing Information MAY be associated with a file through a DEP5 file, but you
SHOULD create a `REUSE.toml` file instead. The DEP5 file is deprecated, meaning
that it is expected to disappear from a future iteration of this specification.

The DEP5 file MUST be named `dep5` and stored in the `.reuse/` directory in the
root of the Project (i.e. `.reuse/dep5`).

The `License` tag MUST be followed by a valid SPDX License Expression describing
the licensing of the associated files.

The `Copyright` tag MUST be followed by a Copyright Notice. The prefix of the
Copyright Notice MAY be omitted.

An example of a DEP5 file:

```
Format: https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/
Upstream-Name: Project
Upstream-Contact: Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
Source: https://example.com/jane/project

Files: po/*.po po/*.pot
Copyright: 2019 Translation Company
License: GPL-3.0-or-later
```

## Order of precedence

If a Commentable File contains Licensing Information but also has an adjacent
`.license` file, then the Licensing Information defined in the `.license` file
takes precedence, and the Commentable File's contents are ignored. For all
intents and purposes, this counts as the `.license` file's Licensing Information
being inside the Commentable File.

Licensing Information defined in `.reuse/dep5` is aggregated with the Licensing
Information found in the Covered Files. For clarity, this means that if the SPDX
License Expressions in a file's comment header and in the section for that file
in `.reuse/dep5` do not agree with each other, then both SPDX License
Expressions will apply to the file.

The order of precedence for `REUSE.toml` files is described in the respective
section, and is managed using the `precedence` key.

## Format of Copyright Notices

A Copyright Notice MUST start with a tag, word or symbol (collectively:
prefixes) from the following list:

- `SPDX-FileCopyrightText` (or `SPDX-SnippetCopyrightText` in Snippets)
- Copyright
- Â©

It is RECOMMENDED to use the `SPDX-FileCopyrightText` tag. You MAY add '(C)',
'(c)' or 'Â©' after the prefix.

A Copyright Notice MUST be terminated by a newline.

The Copyright Notice MUST contain the name of the copyright holder. The
copyright notice SHOULD contain the year of publication and the contact address
of the copyright holder. The order of these items SHOULD be: year, name, contact
address.

The year of publication MAY be a single year, multiple years, or a span of
years.

The copyright holder SHOULD be an individual, list of individuals, group, legal
entity, or any other descriptor by which one can easily identify the copyright
holder(s).

Any contact address SHOULD be in between angle brackets.

You MAY add any further information to the Copyright Notice.
