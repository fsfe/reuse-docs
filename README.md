# REUSE documents

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)
[![reuse compliant](https://reuse.software/badge/reuse-compliant.svg)](https://reuse.software/)

We're working to make managing copyrights and licenses in free and open
source software easier. This is a collection of tutorials, FAQs and specifications to demonstrate how 
to add copyright and license information to a project in ways which allow
for more automation.

## Install

There's no installation here, only the plain text documents. The sister repository [reuse-website](https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-website) includes this repository as a submodule to display it on [reuse.software](https://reuse.software).

## Usage

Go to [reuse.software](https://reuse.software) and enjoy :-) If your project follows the reuse
guidelines, we encourage you to show that in your `README.md` and similar! Just
copy this badge into your readme:

`

## Contribute

We'd love to get feedback on these practices, ideally in the form
of pull requests which we can discuss around.

We also accept and appreciate feedback by creating issues in the project or by sending e-mail to the project team at `<reuse at lists dot fsfe.org>`.
