# REUSE documents

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)
[![REUSE compliant](https://reuse.software/badge/reuse-compliant.svg)](https://reuse.software/)

We're working to make managing copyrights and licenses in free and open
source software easier. This is a collection of tutorials, FAQs and specifications to demonstrate how 
to add copyright and license information to a project in ways which allow
for more automation.

## Install

There's no installation here, only the plain text documents. The sister repository [reuse-website](https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-website) includes this repository as a submodule to display it on [reuse.software](https://reuse.software).

## Usage

Go to [reuse.software](https://reuse.software) and enjoy :-) If your project follows the reuse
guidelines, we encourage you to show that in your `README.md` and similar! Just register your
project with the [REUSE API](https://api.reuse.software/) and copy the resulting badge code in
your README file.

## Contribute

We'd love to get feedback on these practices, ideally in the form
of pull requests which we can discuss around.

We also accept and appreciate feedback by creating issues in the
project or by sending an e-mail to the [public REUSE mailing
list](https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/reuse).

### Translation

Translation happens by conversion Markdown into _gettext_ using
[po4a](https://po4a.org).  To generate the _.md_ files from the
_gettext .po_ files, run:  `po4a po/po4a.conf`.
